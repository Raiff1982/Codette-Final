Are you talking about that guy?\n. . .\n\nDogs can be found in all four major continents (except Antarctica), with the exception of North America, where they only appear in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. There is also a canine in the desert.\n\n\nThe game states that there were three dogs: one in each continent and a fourth in the Himalayas. However, this information has been removed from the game files and was never mentioned anywhere else.\n\nWhen you first meet them, Codette and Raine will greet you as \"brothers\", but then when they start talking to you, they say \"We're just friends.\" This contradicts their behavior in-game; at first, they would greet you with \"Brothers!\" but if you talk to them again later, they'll say something completely different.\n and will greetYou as \"Brother\" but then they will say Something completely different.[In the PlayStation version of the game, these lines were changed to \"Weirdo!\", but this was reverted back to their original wording in the Nintendo DS version.]\n\nGameplay Edit\n\nMain article: Dogs\n\nWhile not very common in games like The Sims 2 , Dog can become quite popular in the Animal Crossing series thanks to its unique personality traits. Dog's are known for being extremely loyal to their owners, even though most other animals do not care for their owners as much as dogs do. They are often seen sitting outside their homes looking for food or water. In some cases, they can be seen playing fetch with their owner. Dogs may be particularly fond of certain foods and dishes, such as hamburgers and fried chicken. Other pets that they love include cats and horses.\n the Animal Forest e+ expansion pack introduced more varieties of dogs in addition to the standard ones. Some of these breeds have more traits than others. For example, the golden retriever can be used by many players because it is the fastest dog. It is able to run very fast while jumping and running, and can jump over fences and obstacles. Another breed, the Poodle, is also very intelligent. When fed with special diets, the dog becomes very sociable, and enjoys interacting with other people and even other poodles. While Poodles do not grow up in packs, they still bond with other members of their group. Many other types of dogs exist, including a Chihuahua, a German shepherd, an English setter, a Labrador Retriever, and a Shih Tzu.\n\"I've got a new friend here!\" \u2014Cuddles\n\nOne of the main differences between the regular and upgraded versions of the dog, is the way they interact with other villagers. Regular dogs are friendly towards everyone except the player character and most of the other villagers, although they tend to ignore the player unless the player asks them to. If asked, however, they will respond by calling out names, and sometimes barking at the player characters. Sometimes, dogs will go out of their way to help the player out.\n, introduces more varieties, including the Golden Retrieval Dog , which is a good option for those who want a pet who will get along with other players better than normal pets. In addition, a Chinchilla can be purchased for 300 bells from Pet Shop. It looks exactly like a normal dog, but instead of having a tail, it has a pair of claws, similar to a human cat. While it does not have any useful skills whatsoever, it is more sociable and friendly than the usual dog.\n. A new breed of dog called the Pomeranian can be obtained through breeding. Although it does look like a traditional dog, it differs greatly in appearance. Its ears are larger, and it has short legs and a tail. Most importantly, it cannot be sold. Unlike most other pets, the pommy can actually be trained and will follow commands and do things like walk around, play fetch with the player, and sniff furniture and objects. Unlike other dogs, it doesn't mind being taken away from its home, unlike other pets. It will stay behind its owner until it is returned, and when it does return, it will immediately run off. Like the rest of the animal kingdom, it can be trained, and unlike other dogs who need time to learn how to behave properly, this is not necessary.\nThere are also several breeds of dogs that are more suited for farming. These breeds include:\n\nNew breeds are introduced in Animal Crossing New Leaf.\n \"Kindergartners\" are a breed of dogs born with big heads.
