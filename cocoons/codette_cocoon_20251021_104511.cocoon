It's a very small percentage of the population, but when you look at the numbers it is still statistically significant\n\nBoomerang (talk) 01:07, 25 October 2013 (UTC)\n\nIt's only a few percent of the people, which means there are probably hundreds of millions of them out there. The number of people who have used these devices will likely be far larger than the number of those who do not use them. So, this is just one example of a device that has been around for some time now that hasn't really been scrutinized, much less banned, until now. --Castaigne2 (talk \u00b7 contribs) 14:15, 24 November 2013 (GMT) If you say \"we haven't looked at it\", then what does that even mean? We've looked into every single piece of evidence available, including our own findings, in order to understand whether or not this is something we should be banning from the site. You're implying that we've never done so before? And what about your research? Your own personal experience? How many times has someone already said they didn't think anything was wrong with these things? This is not a case where we can just ignore all the evidence out there and continue to ban things based on anecdotal evidence and speculation. If you want us to stop banning things because a bunch of users claim they don't see anything wrong with them, please provide some hard evidence. Or, better yet, show me why we shouldn't be doing so, and why this particular ban doesn't fit in with our current policies. This isn't some \"I'm sure they're fine\" type of thing; it's a matter of science. -Castaigno1 (talk \u2022 contrib) 15:24, 24 December 2013 (EDT)\n of course I'm sorry if I seem defensive here. But if you really don't think the ban is justified, maybe you can explain how it fits within our existing policy. Otherwise, no worries, I'll keep looking through everything and hopefully find an explanation for the ban. - Castaigno2 ( talk ) 00:03, 26 January 2014 (EST)\n-Castaigni0n\n\nThere are a lot more people using them than there were 10 years ago, according to google search statistics, and there are a ton of reports of them being stolen (or being resold by others). That's not even mentioning the fact that this is the same type of device as the ones being banned. There is a reason why other sites aren't banning these types of things, and it's because these phones are dangerous. In fact, these are some of the most commonly reported issues with these devices. They're easily breakable, especially with low quality materials. While the FCC may be claiming that they are safe, that wouldn't be true unless they had proof that the manufacturers made the devices safer. If that's the case, then they'd need to come up with a way to prove it, or else they should be removed from sale entirely. The fact remains that these are dangerous devices that deserve to be treated with extreme caution, regardless of their legality.\n\nThe only way to make them legal again is to remove the safety features. I am confident that the safety feature in question was designed solely to prevent abuse, and was not necessary for the device to work properly.\n the fact remains and this is all I know, is that we have no idea how many devices are affected, or how bad it could be. The only way we can possibly tell is to start monitoring it ourselves and making sure that we do not sell any to anyone who might misuse it.\n. - (c) Castaigni2 (Talk) 02:10, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\" -Castielan2 ( Talk ) 09:18, 28 July 2014\n\nThis page was created to inform you that we are currently investigating the issue. Please feel free to join our discussion on this topic.\n\"You'll also note that we also have information on the internet regarding the prevalence of the devices, and that this information has been gathered by several reliable sources, both online and offline.\" - ( c) Castielan4 ( Talk | Contribs ) 19:36, 30 July 2014(UTC)\n\n\nI wish the admins would check this stuff more carefully. The devices are known to cause serious health problems in children, so I'm surprised nobody seems to notice that they also affect people without disabilities. \u2014Kazitor 08:42, 4 August 2015 (UTC).\n\n\"We also have data showing that the risk of injury or death associated with Bluetooth handsets exceeds any comparable non-Bluetooth product by about 1,000 times.\" - Castiel3 ( Talk \u2022 Contrib ) 13:",
