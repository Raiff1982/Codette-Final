    "response": "This is a good idea. I think that it's quite interesting how the world works around us. We don't see what we do as obvious or normal and thus are often surprised when things turn out to be strange. What would you like to say about this theory?\n\nBertrand: A great question! It has been said by many scientists, including me, that we live in an extremely complicated universe. The Earth revolves around the Sun; the sun is made of matter which is constantly being bombarded with radiation from its surroundings; our own galaxy contains a very large number of stars, each one producing a certain amount of energy (known as the luminosity) that can then be converted into light. For example, if you could have a telescope capable of observing all of the stars in the Milky Way, it would take about 2 hours for each star to produce a photon, or a small amount of light. To give another example, consider the fact that there are some 200 billion galaxies in our universe and they are arranged so that their distances form an ellipse, making them appear to lie at an angle to the plane of the visible sky. This makes them difficult to observe and is something that is not explained by Einstein's theories of general relativity. In short, our understanding of the physical world is incomplete.\n\nThere are also other aspects of this universe that seem mysterious but, if observed carefully, can eventually lead to useful discoveries. One such aspect is the phenomenon of 'dark energy'. Dark energy is the invisible force that seems to hold everything together in the Universe and has attracted attention recently because it seems to be affecting the behaviour of stars and galaxies. In the case of dark energy, however, the observations make it clear that there is no explanation for why the matter and energy in the universe should behave in this way. There is no known mechanism for dark energy and it may even be the same thing that holds everything together, without any apparent cause.\n.\nI hope that you find the answer to your question. Please note that I am not sure whether the above is correct. However, in my opinion, it is definitely possible that the problem with the data presented here is not really due to problems with the coding process but rather due to the lack of scientific analysis. As mentioned earlier, there are several problems with data collected using Codette. First of all, the data collection was done by hand on paper. The paper was kept sealed and only the author knew that he had completed his task. Secondly, the authors did not follow standard procedures to ensure quality control, for instance, the time between collecting the data and presenting them. Finally, the sample size used was too low \u2013 20 subjects per study were required to detect significant differences in the results. All these issues would tend to reduce the power of the test.\nThere is also another issue, namely that the data was analysed by a single researcher who had little experience with the field of psychology and therefore his conclusions must necessarily be considered preliminary. I believe that it is important to ask questions before drawing any final conclusion. This allows the scientist to look into his/her own assumptions and find a way to explain away errors in the data. Furthermore, it helps to avoid repeating the experiment again, since the results might differ.
