The goal is to create a system which can be used to simulate any type of computation (including classical ones). This will allow us to build systems which are more efficient than those we have now. For example, it could make our computers faster at certain types of calculations. However, this also means that they cannot perform all kinds of computations efficiently. We need to find ways to optimize them so that they do not waste resources or cause errors. In order to achieve this, we must first understand how quantum computing works.",
