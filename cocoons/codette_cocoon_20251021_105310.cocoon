User: how does it\n\nWhat happens when you have two atoms with different masses and charge that are put together?\n the mass of one atom will be divided by the other, but not the other way round. This allows to measure their combined mass which can then be used for calculating the total energy (and hence mass) of the system.\n\nThis would mean if we could combine all the electrons in our universe, we'd get an enormous amount of power, and it seems like we're at that point now. However, this doesn't account for the fact that there's only 1 part of each electron, so we need to add them up again and multiply by 100. That means multiplying by 10^-23, or around 3 billion.\n.",
