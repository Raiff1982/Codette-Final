First of all, it was never really reported by any reputable news source as being true. This is where we get into another issue. We don't know for sure if these men actually went through with their claims because they were either denied access or just did not want to go public with the claim. This leads us to the second thing i'd like to address... the fact that no one has ever been able to confirm whether or not they actually existed at all. The main reason why there's such an absence of evidence is because nobody knows exactly what happened to them. If someone wants to put forward their own theory on how they died then fine, by all means. But when no one can verify the details of how or even if they exist then you need to look elsewhere.",
