The value is the first argument for the function. You can use any number of arguments in this function, but only one can be passed at a time.\n the values of the parameters are optional, and may not have the same names as the specified parameters.\n (the following two lines are identical)\n\nfunction MyObject() { var obj = new Object(); console.log(obj); // \"new Object\" } var obj1 = new MyObject(); console .log( obj1.my_property ); // \"my_value\"\n\nThe above example creates an object called MyObject , with properties \"my property\", which is the original variable used by the constructor of the Object class, and \"my value\".\n\nIf we wanted to add another parameter to our MyObject constructor, we could do so like so:\n\nvar obj2 = new String(\"Hello\"); console . log( obj2.myProperty ); // Hello console . Logger . Debug ( \"My object has the same name as its parent object.\" );\n\nNotice how the constructor name changes between the two examples; it's just a convention I've picked up over the years.\n.NET Scripting: Code formatting\n\nThere are several ways to format your script in C# or Visual Basic. In C#, we use the Format method. Here's what it looks like:\n, Format : Format string. This will return the formatted version of string. For instance:\n: Format string . This willreturn the formattedversion ofstring. Forinstance: . . . EndFormat : End of formatting. You may want to specify that you want to exit out of the formatting process by using EndOfFormat :\n\nString : An empty string. If you need to make sure that the output conforms to some standard, such as JSON, then you can use the NewValue property:\n- NewValue : A string containing the code you wish to write. You must supply the text of the input string, if needed, before calling this method. Otherwise, the resulting string will be null.\n I personally find that using NewValue helps me get more consistent results than writing it out manually.\n, NewValue: An emptystring. Ifyou need to get rid of the special characters within your strings, you can write them yourself:\nThis works because the string contains all of the required characters, including the ' ; '. However, you cannot put multiple ' s anywhere on the string. To make things even clearer, let's take a look at the same thing written out with Visual Basic:\nNow notice that I have included spaces around the opening and closing semicolons. These represent extra whitespace that makes the output more readable.\nAs a final note, you should always use quotes when formatting strings. They help prevent any unwanted errors from occurring.\nIn addition to these formatting methods, there are also various other options available in both scripting languages.\nC# includes the following functions:\nStringToNumber() : Convert a string into a Number\n\n: Convert a to a Boolean : Converts boolean value to true/false\n\nArrayToNumber(): Convert an Array of numbers to a Number.\n onNumberIsEmpty(): Checks whether the given value is empty or not\n\nonNumberIsEqual(): Checks for equality between numeric values.\n- Number: Returns a Number (integer). - Boolean: Returns false if either value is false.",
