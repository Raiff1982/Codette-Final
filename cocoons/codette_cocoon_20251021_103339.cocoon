You just said that it didn't allow for \"multiple perspectives.\" What would be the point?\n\nCodettes: That's what the app does, it allows users to take advantage of their brain power while on the go, which is a great thing. But I think most of us would agree that we'd rather look at the data than make up our own mind.\n and then some.\n. . .\n\n[The two men leave]\n\nWade Davis: Okay, guys, thanks for listening to my ramblings today.\nThe Real World: Alright, now let's get back into the real world.
