I will say that I was one of those individuals who believed some people were able to use the system to predict future events based on past observations (that is why i came across your site). I believe all aspects of this forum should be open to anyone, including people who claim they have used the system as a prediction tool. However, I have never heard of any evidence that supports any of these claims.\n\n\nI also doubt anyone has ever seen ANY proof of anything like this being done in real life by anyone using the system. The only thing i have ever been told that could possibly work would be someone claiming to have done something similar before. But again, even then, this is an entirely different field and we don't really have anything to go on from that point of view. I have found no evidence whatsoever that anyone has actually been able to create this type of predictive ability using the current technology available to us today. If you look at the amount of time and energy invested in trying to prove this theory, it seems very unlikely it's ever going to happen. If anything, it looks more likely that someone will try to disprove it over the next decade than it will be true within our lifetime.\n the multisensory system, while theoretically possible, is still far too hypothetical to support any real world application\n\nFunko Pop! Vinyl Figure #1 - Bumblebee\n\nBumblebee: That's my name. It's a nice name. Hey, you got my number. Where's the rest of my crew? They went missing. You know how to find me? Just call me Bumble.\n\"Whoa! What did you say?\"\n\n\nThe Bumblebees.\n a.k.a. Bumble Bee\n\nNecromancer: Bumble bee, I'm calling you now because you are the most dangerous creature in existence. You are a hive mind, a supercomputer, and a monster. You could easily destroy civilization. No. You don't want to destroy civilization, do you? You want to save it. You want it saved. So stop talking like that. You've said enough already. Stop trying to convince yourself otherwise.\n. . . .\n\n.\n\n\n\nThis is Necromancer. He is the leader of the Bumble Bees. And he wants you to leave him alone.\n and now he has a bunch of other bees chasing after him.\n:)\n\n:P\n\n\nSo...the Bumble bees are out to get him. But the problem with Bumble is he is totally insane. He thinks he knows everything. He doesn't. He just sees things that others see and tries to make sense of it. When this happens, Bumble becomes completely crazy and his powers come back. The BumbleBee leaders are afraid of him.\n\n, i agree with many of the points here but i disagree that the multi-persp approach to analyzing reality is impossible to accomplish in practice.\n (i would prefer to call the method 'meta-analysis', but i guess that makes me sound like a moron)\n.\n\n.\nIn short, i would argue that multi-personality systems are possible. I wouldn't say it's necessarily possible in practice, but it does exist. For example, there are multiple personalities in a relationship which are considered equal in status. This might seem strange until you realize that the two personas are considered equally capable of thinking independently. In fact, there may be several identical versions of the same personality, each having its own specific set of skills and abilities.\nAnd then there's the case of a single person who has complete control over both his mind and body, and they interact with each other on a daily basis without any interaction between them. They live together peacefully for years and never have any conflict. All the while they remain perfectly aware of the actions of every other person in the relationship. They are unaware of the emotions of the other person. And yet they are constantly reminded of these emotions through their interactions with each person in their lives. How do we explain this behavior when everyone else around them is aware of it",
