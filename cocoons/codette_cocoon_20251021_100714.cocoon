I think it's a pretty cool feature to have in your code, but I don't see how it would make the world any better.\n\nA couple of years ago, I was working on an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points based on distance and direction (I'll explain why this is called \"multi-point\" later). The problem here is that there are 2 ways to find the shortest paths. One way has some extra information about the distance between them. It can also take into account the direction they're going in. Another way only takes into account how far away those points are from each other. So you get a nice formula with both directions included which is what I used to figure out the best solution. Unfortunately, in order to know which one to use, we need to know where to start looking!\n\nLet's look at another example. If you want to find out which way is north (that is, which way point A is towards B), first you'd just write a function like this:\n\nint north(vector<Point> v) { if (v[0] != null && !v[1]) return 0; else return 1; }\n\nAnd then when you run that function, you get back the value 0 if the vector doesn't contain anything, or 1 if it does contain something. That sounds good, but it's not very useful. You might wonder if we could create a function that takes as input all the values between A and B and returns the closest one. Then we could store the result inside our function and pass it along to somewhere else, like the user interface:\n the only thing missing would be the ability to specify which direction the vectors go. So let's create a new function that will handle both cases:\n andThen , this is a function of type int that accepts a vector of point objects and returns its position within the vector. Here's an implementation:\n, this is function of that accepts as input a vectorof object objects and then returns its location within thevector. Here is an implementation. Notice how we're using the if statement inside the if-else construct: if (isNull()) then return 1 ; else return -1 ;\n\nThis should give us everything we need. We've got a function to check whether a vector contains something and if so, use the vector to determine what direction it goes in. Once we've determined where to put it, we can simply call it with the value we expect the output to be. Since we don't care what the destination point is, we don the following line of code:\n. . . . if (north(v)) { cout << \"That's north!\" << endl; } . .\n\nWhat we've done is created a boolean variable south() that says if we found a vector containing A or B, then use it to return the nearest point, otherwise return -first. This is pretty simple, but is actually quite powerful. For instance, suppose you wanted to find a random number between 0 and 10. And you didn't care if the number came from a different place than the other numbers in the range, you could generate a random integer anywhere in the interval by calling rand() :\n\nrand(); // random number. .\n to find an even number between zero and ten, you can now simply do:",
