In order to accomplish this task, I will be able to answer questions such as \"What does it mean when someone says 'I'm going to go get some coffee'?\" or \"How many times have you typed in the word 'hello'?\". The more information I provide, the better my ability to understand the user's needs. If there is any question which cannot be answered using my knowledge of the language, then I may ask another person to fill in the blank. This process allows us to create a dialogue between two parties without having to speak directly.",
