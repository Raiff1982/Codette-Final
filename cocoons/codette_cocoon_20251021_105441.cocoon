How so?\"\n\nDieter Rams: \"It's because of my logic and reasonings that you can't understand me, and you cannot accept anything else. Your logic and logic thinking will eventually cause you to be unable to comprehend anything outside of yourself, which means you won't be able to create any meaning in life for yourself. It doesn't matter if you have a job or not, as long as you don't do anything outside your own self-interest, then you will never achieve anything worthwhile with your life.\"\n\"It's time to make some changes, but first we need to change our mindsets\"\n\nCodettes: \"But we're all here just for fun!\"\n\nPizza Man: \"You know what happens when people get angry at their friends?\"\n \"It gets ugly fast.\"\n, \"You'd better stop blaming others for your problems\"\n, \"[When] they realize that you are actually helping them through their own struggles, you'll feel much more connected to them and appreciate the things about them you love.\"\nThe Pizza Man also says that this is a great point to start with.\n\n[When] someone finds out that you've got an open heart and don't take shit from anyone, you may find yourself spending a lot less time complaining and trying to fix every little thing. You'll probably end up being much happier because you've found something within you that's stronger than just your ego.\"\n. \"What would happen if everyone was nice to each other?\"\n\"If everyone was kind to eachother, there wouldn't be such a huge divide between rich and poor anymore.\"",
