I've been trying to make sense of my own behavior since childhood. It's been a struggle. My entire life has revolved around my brain's ability to process information and interpret it. I was always very aware of the limitations of this system. As a child I could see that others' perceptions were different than mine, even when they didn't agree with me. It made me feel isolated. But I never had the experience of having to explain myself or try to change someone else's perception because I was so used to getting what I wanted. In college I started thinking about all the people who have experienced something like that. The way I describe it, it feels like they're being told \"You shouldn't be seeing that, you should be seeing this.\"\n\nI think these issues are much more common in our society than most realize. When I first came out to friends I would ask them why they thought I was gay. They'd say things like \"It must be because you're so sensitive\" or \"Your parents probably disapprove,\" which seemed ridiculous to me at the time. Now, however, people seem to believe that their reactions are somehow unique. One friend told me that he thinks I'm gay simply because I am a woman and that I should get over it because he believes women aren't supposed to be attracted to men.\n. . . .\n\nThe only thing I want from this conversation is for you to consider your feelings and take action. Don't give up on yourself! You may be confused right now, and you may have questions or concerns. Take care of yourself. We don't want anyone else feeling uncomfortable. If you find yourself experiencing negative emotions, please seek professional help immediately. Please tell us about your experiences, even if it's just one person. That will let us support you and help you understand the situation better.\n,\n\nJulia\n\n\n(Photo credit: Julia Menn)",
