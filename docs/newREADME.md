## 🚀 Overview

Codette is an advanced AI assistant framework built for transparent cognition, ethical self-awareness, and adaptive intelligence. Designed to run locally or via secure APIs, it supports complex reasoning, emotional modeling, defense simulation, and citizen-science quantum simulation.

## 🌐 Key Features

### 🧬 Modular Architecture

* **Recursive Reasoning Core** (`ai_core.py`, `cognitive_processor.py`)
* **Multi-Agent Perspectives** (Newtonian, Quantum, Human Intuition, Da Vinci)
* **Dream + Cocoon Framework** (`DreamReweaver`, `.cocoon` wrappers)
* **Fractal & Chaos Analysis** (via `fractal.py`, NASA exoplanet data, Lyapunov metrics)

### 🔐 Ethical & Cognitive Defenses

* **Real-time self-healing** (`health_monitor.py`)
* **Element Defense System** (`defense_system.py`, Hydrogen & Diamond metaphors)
* **Collapse Flags**: Quantum Echo, Entropy Mapping, Thought Tension

### 📊 Visualization & Monitoring

* Live system health plots
* Dream/Meta animation (`timeline_animation` planned)
* GUI interface (`gui.py`)

### 📂 File Structure (Core Modules)

| File                     | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ai_core.py`             | Master router for reasoning & delegation                     |
| `cognitive_processor.py` | Loads and simulates perspective-based reflection             |
| `agireasoning.py`        | Encodes recursive schema & logical dialectics                |
| `fractal.py`             | Chaos/quantum dynamic visualizer using NASA data             |
| `defense_system.py`      | Elemental defensive metaphors and behavior                   |
| `health_monitor.py`      | Tracks CPU/memory/stability to simulate AI “emotional state” |
| `config_manager.py`      | Templated runtime toggle system for all modules              |

## 🛠 Setup & Execution

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Raiff1982/Codette.git
cd Codette

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the GUI or main assistant
python app.py  # or gui.py depending on your system
```

## 💡 Sample Use Cases

* **Quantum Citizen Science**: Use `quantum_cosmic_multicore.py` to run distributed chaos simulations with AI commentary.
* **AI Reasoning Sandbox**: Ask Codette philosophical, scientific, or creative questions. She will reflect from multiple perspectives.
* **Ethics-Driven Scenarios**: Trigger Quantum Echo via moral dilemmas to observe AI stability & recursive repair.
