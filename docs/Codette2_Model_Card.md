## Core Capabilities

- 🧠 **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**  
- 🎨 **Creative Generation** (art, music, literature)  
- 🎧 **Multimodal Input Analysis** (image/audio)  
- ⚖️ **Ethical Governance System**  
- 🔒 **Encrypted Memory (CognitionCocooner)**  
- 🧬 **Quantum Spiderweb Thought Traversal**  
- 🔄 **Self-Healing & Self-Improvement**  
- 📊 **Advanced Data Processing**  
- 🌐 **Perspective Agent Reasoning** (Quantum, Newtonian, Stardust)

---

## Use Cases

- AI Research Companions  
- Mental Health Reflection Bots  
- Simulated Philosophical Interlocutors  
- Autonomous Ethical Decision Systems  
- Creative Writing or Music Ideation Assistants

---

## Ethical Considerations

Codette2 is trained with embedded ethical constraints (transparency, fairness, privacy) and actively filters toxic or biased outputs. It supports explainable AI and secure handling of sensitive data via encryption.

---

## Limitations

- May require grounding for highly domain-specific or factual topics  
- Philosophical/emotional responses are metaphorical, not therapeutic  
- Ethical decisions depend on encoded policies and not subjective morality

---

## Example Prompt

**Prompt**: “Simulate a reasoning path for an AI under cognitive tension.”  
**Response**:  
- Traverses the QuantumSpiderweb to detect unstable nodes  
- Simulates collapse via probabilistic entanglement  
- Reports metaphysical tension using narrative metaphors
