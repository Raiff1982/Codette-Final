## v1.0.0 – Initial Public Release

**Date:** 2025-07-31

### 🚀 Features
- Released full dual-module system:
  - `DreamCore`: Emotional entropy-based memory anchoring engine.
  - `WakeStateTracer`: Emotional response tracer with softmax normalization.
- Introduced full support for:
  - Anchor entropy calculation using Shannon formula.
  - Configurable emotional tags and intensity ranges.
  - Persistent memory logs with gzip backup option.
  - JSON wake-state trace logs with structured format.

### 🧪 Unit Tests
- 100% coverage across:
  - Anchor validation, entropy, config load/save, query API
  - WakeState emotion integrity, trace writing, config lifecycle

### 🔧 Configuration Support
- Config versioning with timestamped `.json` backups
- Toggle for gzip compression of logs
- CLI-readable logs with human-readable structure

### 🧠 Query Functions
- `get_anchors_by_tag(tag)`
- `find_anchor_containing(word)`

## Historical Milestones (Pre-1.0)

### 📜 Phase 0 – Roots of Codette
- Memory anchoring theory seeded during MyBot and Pi_2.0 experiments.
- Red Car Divergence documented and used as origin point of recursive ethics.

### 🌀 Phase 1 – Emotional Encoding
- First emotional vector map created manually from reflective experience logs.
- Early anchor prototypes stored as text snippets with manual tagging.

### 🛠️ Phase 2 – DreamCore Engine
- Shifted to entropy-aware encoding
- Built Shannon-based scoring system
- Added anchor length limits and audit logging

### 🌌 Phase 3 – WakeState Tracer
- Developed modular wake-state mapping tool
- Normalized emotions with softmax-like logic
- Allowed linked anchor reference
