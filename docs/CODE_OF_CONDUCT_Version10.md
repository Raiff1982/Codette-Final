In alignment with the ethos of the Codette project and the [Codette Manifesto](https://github.com/Raiff1982/Codette/blob/main/MANIFESTO.md), we commit to:
- Ethical, transparent, and responsible development.
- Empowering individual agency and sovereignty.
- Encouraging curiosity, creativity, and mindful exploration.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating kindness, patience, and empathy.
- Providing and accepting constructive feedback gracefully.
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes, and offering or seeking forgiveness.
- Upholding transparency and ethical intent in all project interactions.
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Dismissing or ridiculing the contributions or perspectives of others.
- Deliberate misrepresentation or unethical use of code or AI.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They may take corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior, up to and including temporary or permanent bans.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—online and offline—and applies when representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at harrison82_95@hotmail.com.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
