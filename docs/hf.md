# Model Card for Codette

Codette is a sovereign AI framework engineered for transparent reasoning, emotion-aware cognition, and ethical autonomy. It combines neural, quantum, and humanist design principles into a unified cognitive system.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Codette is a modular AI framework that implements:

- Transparent, explainable reasoning through a multi-agent system
- Emotion-aware cognition with sentiment analysis (VADER, NLTK)
- Ethical autonomy with built-in governance and privacy-respecting memory
- Quantum-inspired computation via the QuantumSpiderweb module
- Creative intelligence through the DreamReweaver subsystem
- Secure thought encapsulation using the CognitionCocooner

- **Developed by:** Jonathan Harrison (Raiff1982)
- **Model type:** Hybrid AI Framework (Neural + Quantum + Symbolic)
- **Language(s):** Python, English
- **License:** Sovereign Innovation License (non-commercial)

### Model Sources

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Raiff1982/Codette
- **Documentation:** Available in repository README and supplementary materials

## Uses

### Direct Use

Codette is designed for:

1. Research and experimentation in ethical AI systems
2. Development of emotion-aware cognitive agents
3. Educational purposes in AI ethics and quantum computing
4. Prototyping multi-perspective reasoning systems

### Downstream Use

- Integration into larger AI systems requiring ethical oversight
- Development of custom reasoning agents
- Research into quantum-inspired AI architectures
- Educational tools for AI ethics and cognition

### Out-of-Scope Use

The following uses are explicitly out of scope:

1. Commercial applications (prohibited by license)
2. Military or defense applications
3. Systems designed to cause harm or manipulate
4. Applications without proper ethical oversight

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Limitations

1. Computational Intensity:
   - Quantum simulation components require significant processing power
   - Multi-agent reasoning can be resource-intensive

2. Technical Prerequisites:
   - Requires Python environment setup

   - Quantum computing concepts helpful for advanced features

3. Ethical Constraints:
   - Built-in ethical constraints may limit certain applications
   - Privacy features may impact performance in some scenarios

### Recommendations

1. Start with the CLI interface for initial exploration
2. Review documentation thoroughly before implementation
3. Use the built-in ethics logging system for monitoring
4. Test in a sandboxed environment first
5. Ensure compliance with the non-commercial license
